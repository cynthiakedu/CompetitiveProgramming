Points and lines 
Cross product $$a \times b$$ of $$a = (x_1, y_1)$$ and $$b = (x_2, y_2)$$ is $$x_1y_2-x_2y_1$$
Positive $$\Rightarrow$$ $$b$$ turns left (placed directly after $$a$$)
Zero $$\Rightarrow$$ does not turn
Negative $$\Rightarrow$$ $$b$$ turns right
Example
Code
```
P a = {4, 2}; 
P b = {1, 2}; 
long double p = (conj(a)*b).Y //6
```
Point location 
Use cross product $$(p-s1) \times (p-s2)$$ to test whether a point $$p$$ is located on the left or right side of a line through $$s1$$ and $$s2$$
Positive $$\Rightarrow p$$ is on left side
$$0 \Rightarrow p$$ on the same line
Negative $$\Rightarrow p$$ is on right side
Line segment intersection 
Test whether two line segments $$ab$$ and $$cd$$ intersect
Case 1 = line segments on the same line and intersect 
Use cross products to check if all points on the same line
Sort points and check whether the line segments overlap 
Case 2 = line segments have a common vertex that is the only intersection point
Check $$a = c$$, $$a = d$$, $$b = c$$ or $$b = d$$
Case 3 = exact one intersection point that isn't vertex of any segment
$$c$$ and $$d$$ are on different sides of a line through $$a$$ and $$b$$ 
$$a$$ and $$b$$ are on different sides of a line through $$c$$ and $$d$$
